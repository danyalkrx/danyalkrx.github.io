         <h1>Lab News: Celebrating Our Achievers!</h1>

       <p>We are thrilled to announce a series of prestigious awards received by our talented lab members. Their hard work and dedication continue to drive our research forward.</p>

       <h2>New Postdoctoral Fellow: Dr. Majid Ghareghani Joins the Team!</h2>
       <p>We are excited to welcome Dr. Majid Ghareghani, who joined our lab as a postdoctoral fellow in May 2025.
         Majid brings a wealth of experience in neurodegenerative diseases.
         He completed his doctorate at Laval University, Canada, where his research focused on multiple sclerosis.
         Following his doctoral studies, he undertook a two-year postdoctoral fellowship in Alzheimer’s disease in the laboratory of Dr. Serge Rivest. <br><br>
         In our lab, Majid will be spearheading vital research into cellular senescence – a process of cellular aging – in oligodendrocytes and Subventricular Zone (SVZ)-derived neural stem cells.
         His work will investigate the impact of senescence on these critical cell types in the context of aging and their ability to contribute to remyelination, a key repair process in multiple sclerosis.
       </p>

       <h2>Elham Awarded MS Canada Postdoctoral Fellowship</h2>
       <p>Congratulations to Elham, who will be joining our team as an MS Canada Postdoctoral Fellow!
         This highly competitive fellowship is awarded by MS Canada to support promising researchers conducting innovative studies aimed at understanding and finding solutions for multiple sclerosis.
         Elham will be focusing on crucial research into the aging of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) and their role in MS.
         We eagerly anticipate her contributions to this important field.</p>

       <h2>Mahdi Receives University of Toronto Excellence Award (UTEA)</h2>
       <p>Kudos to Mahdi on receiving the University of Toronto Excellence Award (UTEA)!
         The UTEA program provides undergraduate students with valuable opportunities to gain hands-on research experience.
         These awards recognize academic excellence and connect students with faculty-led research projects across various disciplines, including health and life sciences.
         This award will support Mahdi's continued involvement in our lab's research endeavors.</p>

       <h2>Joy Earns CIHR Undergraduate Student Research Award (USRA) for Black Students </h2>
       <p>We are proud to announce that Joy has been awarded the CIHR Undergraduate Student Research Award (USRA) for Black Students.
         This specific USRA, offered by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), aims to nurture interest and develop potential in health research for Black undergraduate students.
         It provides them with practical research experience and mentorship, encouraging them to pursue graduate studies and careers in health sciences.</p>

       <h2>Mridula Selected for Immunology Summer Student Research Program (ISSRP)</h2>
       <p>Congratulations to Mridula for her acceptance into the Immunology Summer Student Research Program (ISSRP) at the University of Toronto.
         This program offers undergraduate students an immersive research experience within the Department of Immunology.
         Participants engage in cutting-edge research projects, attend seminars, and present their findings, fostering a deeper understanding of immunology and research methodologies.</p>
