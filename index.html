       <p>
           I am an undergraduate student at the University of Toronto, majoring in Biology for Health Sciences with a double minor in Anthropology and Biomedical Communications.
           <br><br>
           Outside of academia I like to work on random <a href="/projects">projects</a> to keep my mind going and work on my creativity and skills.
           In particular, I am very passionate about programming and research and hope to combine these interests with my academics in the future.
           I also volunteer in multiple organizations to contribute to my community and gain experience.
           <br><br>
           I have conducted research in multiple topics, the most intensive and note-worthy being <a>propranolol induced depression</a>, <a>Crohn's Disease</a>, and <a>the early domestication of goats in Iran</a>.
           Hopefully I have the opportunity to expand my research portfolio and work with experts in the field.
           <br><br>
           Some of my other hobbies include reading, coding, video production and basketball.
