       <h1>Niger’s Rapidly Growing Population and the Need for Improved Family Planning Methods</h1>
       <span style="margin:10px">06-2022</span>

       <p>An article researching the causes of Niger's high birth rate and discussing the ways in which it can be returned to a healthy level.
           Within the article I show how contraceptive use is extremely low, the governments plans are ignored, the unsustainability of the growth, the cultural significance of large families, low education rates, and weak women's rights.
           The main reason for Niger's extreme population boom is the decrease in mortality rates, causing families to have far more children due to historic ideas of not all children surviving to adulthood.
           I chose to focus most of my research on the increased need for women's rights and education since it would allow women to make more decisions on their families and have the opportunity to work, which would ultimately decrease the fertility rate.
           This research was presented in a policy brief format.
