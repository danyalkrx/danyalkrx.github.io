       <h1>Do Beta-Blockers Increase the Risk of Developing Depression</h1>
       <span style="margin:10px">07-12-2021</span>

       <p>An article attempting to solve the dilemma of whether beta-blockers, specifically propranolol, cause depression and other mental health disorders.
       Beta-blockers are a group of drugs commonly used to treat hypertension but have been linked to depression and other issues since the 1960s when H.J. Waal introduced the idea of propranolol-induced depression.
       The article presents three points of proof for the "yes" and "no" sides of the debate.
       The "yes" side evidence was that beta-blockers are lipophilic and can alter nervous system activity, the synergistic effects of beta-blockers on the pathophysiology of depression, and how they lead to an increase in suicides shown by a study in Denmark.
       For the "no" side, the evidence was that users are typically older with pre-existing chronic medical conditions, users do not take their properly described dosage, and that recent studies have shown that beta-blocker therapy has lowered the mortality rates of those suffering from myocardial infractions.
       My research concluded that "it is unlikely that beta-blockers are the sole contributor to depression or have a significant impact on the development in most patients."</p>
