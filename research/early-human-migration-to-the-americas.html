       <h1>Early Human Migration to North and South America</h1>
       <span style="margin:10px">09-02-2023</span>

       <p>An article highlighting the recent research regarding the migration of humans into the Americas.
           Three articles were used.
           The first discussed human remains found in Late Pleistocene Alaska from the Upward Sun River site.
           I discussed the importance of the findings in providing an understanding of the genetic makeup and gene flow in Native Americans.
           The next article analyzed genomes of ancient human remains from Northeast Brazil and compared them with known ancient and recent genomic data to determine the most likely migration routes as humans began to travel down the Atlantic coast of South America.
           This article also provided meaningful information on the genetic makeup of ancestry of Native Americans, specifically from South America.
           The final article provided a broad overview of human migration to the Americas.
           One important finding from this article was that Australasian DNA is present in South Americans but not North Americans, providing evidence of a secondary migration.
