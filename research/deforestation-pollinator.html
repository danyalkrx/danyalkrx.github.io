       <h1>Impact of Deforestation on Pollinator Communities in Tropical Landscapes</h1>
       <span style="margin:10px">04-2022</span>

       <p>An article discussing the role of pollinators on flowering plants and the downward trends due to deforestation.
           The research was expanding on past research done by Torres-Vanegas et al.
           My research discussed the direct and indirect effects of tropical deforestation on mating quality in <i>Heliconia tortuosa</i>.
           The results of the study showed that "deforestation has a clear impact on the functional composition of pollinators."
           One result was that the proportion of high-mobility hummingbirds was found to increase significantly when there is a higher proportion of forested area within 1 km.
           Deforestation was found to decrease the proportion of high-mobility hummingbirds, decrease the genetic diversity among tropical plants, alter the distribution of floral resources, and increase direct competition for floral resources.
